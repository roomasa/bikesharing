# Bike Sharing


## Overview of Project

The overall goal of this project is to analyze bike sharing data from NYC and to determine if it would be a successful business venture in Des Moines. 

### Purpose

To help analyze bikesharing data, determine maximum use times, determine who the types of users are and to use the findings to launch a successful program in Iowa. 

## Results
 
The dataset overall included information on 2,344,224 bike rides.

Duration for most rides was 20 minutes or less. See line graph below.

Average trip duration varied by age, peaking among those born in 1969 and gradually increasing among those born in 1940 to 2000.

Overall bike rides were more common among men, the trend for bike rides being mostly under 20 minutes was same for men and women. See figure below.

Overall the bike usage was highest on weekday mornings at about 8am and weekday evenings between 5-7pm. See heat map below.

Men overall did more bike rides compared to women, but the trends regarding maximum time of use were similar among men and women with the highest use times being on weekday mornings and evenings. See heat map below.

Male subscribers were the highest users of bike rides, with the use being particularly high on Thursdays and Fridays. See graph below.

## Summary
In NYC, bike usage was high with over 2 million bike rides undertaken in the month of August. Men were more likely to use bike sharing services. The subscribers formed the highest proportion of total users. The peak usage times were weekday mornings and weekday evenings. Most bike rides tended to be of relatively short duration (under 20 minutes). Over time the bike utilization builds up and needs to be taken into account together with peak bike usage times to plan when to conduct bike maintenance. In order to determine the feasability of this project in Des Moines it would be helpful to gather more data from Des Moines. Helpful data would include, what the current mode of transportation is for most people and the demographics of the population there.
