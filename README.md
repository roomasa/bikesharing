# Bike Sharing


## Overview of Project

The overall goal of this project is to analyze bike sharing data from NYC and to determine if it would be a successful business venture in Iowa. 

### Purpose

To help analyze bikesharing data, determine maximum use times, determine who the types of users are and to use the findings to launch a successful program in Iowa. 

## Results
 
The dataset overall included information on 2,344,224 bike rides.

Duration for most rides was 20 minutes or less. See line graph below.


Average trip duration varied by age, peaking among those born in 1969 and gradually increasing among those born in 1940 to 2000.
